            <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>

                <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1942</strong>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li><strong>1944</strong>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1945</strong>- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                <li><strong>1953</strong>- crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that respond</li>
                <li><strong>1962</strong>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong>- receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            </ul>
